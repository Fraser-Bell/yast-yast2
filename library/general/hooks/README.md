# Default hook search path

This is the default directory used by yast for searching hook scripts if not 
specified otherwise by the documentation for a particular workflow using the
hooks feature. 

More information is to be found in the main readme file for hooks in
`/usr/share/doc/packages/yast2/Hooks.md`

If you are going to make use of the installation hooks, please put you scripts
into the subdirectory `installation`.
